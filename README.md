# Project Euler Practice

This repository contains solutions to the [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require creative solutions. Each problem is designed to be solved with efficient algorithms and mathematical reasoning.

## Getting Started

To get started with Project Euler, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. Navigate to the project directory.
1. Open the `problems` folder.
1. Read the problem description and constraints carefully.


### Submitting Solutions

To submit your solution, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder with your name in the `solutions` directory.
1. Implement your solution in the JavaScript programming language.
1. Place your solution file(s) inside your folder.
1. Commit and push your changes to the repository.


For example, if your name is John Doe, you would create a folder named `john-doe` inside the `solutions` directory and place your solution file(s) inside that folder.

Make sure to organize your solutions properly and avoid modifying other students' folders or files.

## GitHub Flow
[GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that allows for collaboration and easy integration of changes. Follow these steps to use GitHub Flow:

1. Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes.
2. Make your changes in the new branch. This can include adding, modifying, or deleting files.
3. Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
4. Push your branch to the remote repository.
5. Open a pull request (PR) to propose your changes for review.
6. Discuss and review the changes with your team members.
7. Make any necessary updates based on the feedback received.
8. Once the changes are approved, merge the pull request into the main branch.
9. Delete the branch after it has been merged.

Following GitHub Flow helps maintain a clean and organized codebase, facilitates collaboration, and ensures that changes are properly reviewed before being merged into the main branch.
