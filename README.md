# Project Euler Practice

This repository contains solutions to the [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require creative solutions. Each problem is designed to be solved with efficient algorithms and mathematical reasoning.

## Getting Started

To get started with Project Euler, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. Navigate to the project directory.
1. Open the problems folder.
1. Read the problem description and constraints carefully.


### Submitting Solutions

To submit your solution, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder with your name in the `solutions` directory.
1. Implement your solution in the JavaScript programming language.
1. Place your solution file(s) inside your folder.
1. Commit and push your changes to the repository.


For example, if your name is John Doe, you would create a folder named `john-doe` inside the `solutions` directory and place your solution file(s) inside that folder.

Make sure to organize your solutions properly and avoid modifying other students' folders or files.
