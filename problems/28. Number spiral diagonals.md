# Problem 28: Number spiral diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<pre>
<span style="color:red">21</span> 22 23 24 <span style="color:red">25</span>
20  <span style="color:red">7</span>  8  <span style="color:red">9</span> 10
19  6  <span style="color:red">1</span>  2 11
18  <span style="color:red">5</span>  4  <span style="color:red">3</span> 12
<span style="color:red">17</span> 16 15 14 <span style="color:red">13</span>
</pre>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in an `n` by `n` spiral formed in the same way?
